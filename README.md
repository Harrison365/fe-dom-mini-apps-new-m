# DOM Mini-Apps

A fun pairing game built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

The JS logic shuffles the colours for each game and allows users to reveal two squares. If they match, the reveal persists, if not, they will be hidden again after a setTimeout timer elapses.

Victory and failure messages are also displayed.
